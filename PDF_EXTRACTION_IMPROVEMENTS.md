# PDF Extraction Improvements

## Summary

Enhanced the PDF extraction system to better handle arXiv papers and other academic PDFs that have complex formatting. The new `PDFExtractorV2` includes:

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Title Extraction
- Skips arXiv identifiers (e.g., "arXiv:1409.3215v3 [cs.CL] 14 Dec 2014")
- Ignores dates, URLs, email addresses, and author affiliations
- Better detection of actual paper titles by looking for mixed-case text
- Validates title length and format

### 2. Improved Abstract Extraction
- More aggressive text cleaning to fix merged words
- Handles ligatures (ﬁ, ﬂ, ﬀ, ﬃ, ﬄ) and other special characters
- Fixes spacing issues common in PDF extraction:
  - Adds spaces between lowercase and uppercase letters
  - Adds spaces between letters and numbers
  - Fixes merged common words (the, and, of, to, in, etc.)
  - Repairs technical terms that often get merged
- Better pattern matching for abstract sections
- Removes page numbers and headers from abstracts

### 3. Unicode Normalization
- Uses NFKD normalization to handle special characters
- Comprehensive ligature mapping
- Better handling of special symbols

### 4. Text Cleaning Methods
- **Aggressive cleaning** for title/abstract extraction
- **Moderate cleaning** for general content
- Preserves readability while fixing extraction artifacts

## Implementation

The enhanced extractor is now used automatically for:
- PDF uploads via the web interface
- PDF imports from URLs
- Batch PDF processing

## Testing

To test the improvements on a specific PDF:

```bash
python test_enhanced_extraction.py path/to/your.pdf
```

This will show a comparison between the old and new extractors.

## Next Steps

If issues persist with specific PDFs:
1. Consider using alternative PDF libraries (pdfplumber, pymupdf)
2. Implement OCR for scanned PDFs
3. Add heuristics for specific publisher formats
