‚è∫ Summary

  I've successfully implemented multi-database support with full UI integration! Here's what was
  accomplished:

  Backend Implementation:

  1. Database Registry System - Created database_manager.py to manage multiple databases
  2. Dynamic Configuration - Updated config.py to support switching between databases
  3. Storage Migration - Existing data automatically migrates to a "default" database named "My
  Documents"
  4. DocumentStore Updates - Modified to work with the current active database
  5. API Endpoints - Added full CRUD operations for database management

  Frontend Implementation:

  1. Database Display - Shows current database name in the header
  2. Database Menu - Dropdown menu to:
    - View all databases with document counts
    - Switch between databases
    - Create new databases
  3. Create Database Modal - Clean form to create new databases with name and description
  4. Real-time Updates - Document counts update automatically

  Key Features:

  - Seamless Switching - Click to switch between databases instantly
  - Automatic Migration - Existing data preserved as "My Documents" database
  - Document Isolation - Each database has its own documents, vectors, PDFs, etc.
  - Visual Feedback - Active database highlighted, loading states shown
  - Persistent State - Current database remembered between sessions

  User Experience:

  - Database name always visible in header
  - Easy dropdown access to all databases
  - Simple creation of new databases
  - Document counts shown for each database
  - Clean, intuitive UI that matches the existing design

  The system is now ready to use! Users can:
  1. See "My Documents" as their current database
  2. Click the dropdown arrow to see all databases
  3. Create new databases with custom names
  4. Switch between databases seamlessly
  5. Each database maintains its own separate collection of documents

  The remaining tasks (CLI commands and export/import updates) are lower priority and can be
  implemented later as needed.
