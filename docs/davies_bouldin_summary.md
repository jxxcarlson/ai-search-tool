# Davies-Bouldin Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Added Davies-Bouldin import** in `server/server.py`:
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, davies_bouldin_score
   ```

2. **Replaced cluster selection logic** (lines 981-998):
   - Changed from silhouette score (higher is better) to Davies-Bouldin score (lower is better)
   - Updated best_score initialization to `float('inf')`
   - Changed comparison to `score < best_score` to find minimum

3. **Updated final clustering score** (line 1005):
   - Now uses `davies_bouldin_score(embeddings, labels)`

4. **Added comment to ClusterResponse** (line 68):
   - Noted that `silhouette_score` field now contains Davies-Bouldin score
   - Kept field name for backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Speed**: Davies-Bouldin is significantly faster than silhouette score
   - No need to compute pairwise distances between all points
   - O(n) vs O(nÂ²) complexity

2. **Still automated**: No manual interpretation needed (unlike elbow method)

3. **Good for document clustering**: Works well with high-dimensional embeddings

## How to Use

1. **Restart the services** to apply changes:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Test clustering** at http://localhost:8080
   - Click "Clusters" to see the new clustering
   - Note: The score shown is now Davies-Bouldin (lower = better clusters)

3. **Interpret the score**:
   - Davies-Bouldin typically ranges from 0 to ~2-3
   - Lower scores indicate better-separated, more compact clusters
   - Score < 1.0 is generally considered good

## Next Steps

If clustering still needs improvement:
1. Increase `max_clusters` in ClusterRequest to test more values
2. Try different initialization methods in KMeans
3. Implement multiple metrics and compare their recommendations
